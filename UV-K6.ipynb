    "One of the holy grails of amateur radio is an inexpensive FM transceiver with a flat response. An old-school\n",
    "ham would call this a radio with *discriminator output and varactor input* but everything is digital and\n",
    "I/Q modulated these days, so *a flat response* is a clearer way to say what we are after. These are radios\n",
    "that are capable of digital modes like 9600 baud GFSK or 4-FSK. Radios such as these are typically expensive\n",
    "mobile units or base stations with packet data ports. These typically cost many hundreds of dollars. To date,\n",
    "only Kenwood has made a hand-held radio (long since discontinued) which exposed this capability directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Quansheng UV-K5 and variants (including the UV-K6) have an active hacking community. The hardware has\n",
    "been well-documented and the firmware reverse-engineered. Customized firmware variants are in wide use. The\n",
    "BK4819 RF IC used in this device is fairly well documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have discovered that with a few trivial hardware modification and some new firmware features, we can\n",
    "enhance these $30 radios to provide a flat response on both transmit and receive, allowing these radios\n",
    "to be used for digital modulation. This article documents those changes and how to get started with digital\n",
    "modes using this radio, along with a modem such as the Mobilinkd TNC4.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Changelog\n",
    "\n",
    " - 2024-06-18 Initial publication.\n",
    " - 2024-07-04 MIC ADC update.\n",
    " - 2024-07-07 MIC capacitor (C77) value change. Notes on BK4819_REG_30 MIC ADC behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview of Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardware changes which are documented below allow passing low-frequency, wide, flat baseband between\n",
    "the digital modem and the radio's RF chip. This is an absolute necessity for digital baseband modulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The firmware changes adds a new Digital (DIG) mode which does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Eliminate pre-emphasis on transmit and de-emphasis on receive.\n",
    " 2. Eliminate the TX & RX 300Hz sub-audio channel high-pass filter which is used for CTCSS and DCS.\n",
    " 4. Eliminate the TX & RX 3000Hz low-pass audio filter.\n",
    " 5. Bypass the transmit low-pass filter.\n",
    " 6. Disable the MIC AGC and the ALC (limiter).\n",
    " 7. Disable squelch.\n",
    " 8. ~~Keep MIC ADC enabled in RX mode to establish and maintain proper DC bias of the MIC input.~~\n",
    " 9. Enable MIC ADC during init for a short period to establish proper DC bias of the MIC input.\n",
    " 10. Reduce turn-around time from ~140ms to less than 80ms by leaving the audio amplifier enabled during\n",
    "    TX. This also reduces a DC offset error at start of RX. The cost is some wasted current use during TX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the EGZUMER firmware, on which these changes are based, already reduces the turn-around time of the\n",
    "stock UV-K6 firmware from over 350ms to around 140ms.\n",
    "\n",
    "# DISCLAIMER\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardware modifications documented here may result in permanent damage to your radio. The firmware\n",
    "changes may have introduced bugs which affect other modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need ~~3 10uF, 10V (or higher) 0603 MLCC capacitors~~ 2 10uF 10V (or higher) 0603 MLCC\n",
    "capacitors, 1 1uF 16V 0603 MLCC capacitor, and the skill and equipment needed to do surface\n",
    "mount work on 0402 parts. A tool for loosening the nuts on the antenna connector and potentiometer\n",
    "(AKA [X-Key Repair Tool](https://amzn.to/3KIrhDV)) will also come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional components are 2 0402 0 Ohm resistors. Two 1.6mm lengths of wire will work in their place.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need a programming cable to flash the firmware.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Caveat\n",
    "\n",
    "The UV-K6 is a rather poor transceiver. It's input filtering is quite wide, and it suffers from the same\n",
    "problem that most of the CCRs&trade; (*Cheap Chinese Radios*) have -- the receiver is subject to desense\n",
    "when any strong signal exists in the passband of the receiver. That said, the Quansheng UV-K6 does\n",
    "substantially better than most of the CCRs that I have tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "# References\n",

    " 2. Remove the antenna.\n",
    " 3. Remove the power/volume knob by pulling straight up.\n",
    " 4. Remove the metal frame from the enclosure by prying the bottom of the case until the frame is released.\n",
    " 5. Be careful not to damage the wires connecting the speaker to the PCB.\n",
    " 6. Carefully slide the frame out by sliding it down until the potentiometer and antenna connector clear the case. Do this gently.\n",
    " 7. Remove the loose plastic piece protecting the speaker-mic connector.\n",
    " 8. Paying attention to the speaker wire, set the enclosure face down and the PCB side up so that the speaker wire connections are accessible.\n",
    " 9. Use a soldering iron to disconnect the two speaker wires. Do not skip this step.\n",
    " 10. Loosen the nuts holding the antenna connector and poteniometer to the frame. There is no need to completely remove them.\n",
    " 11. Using a small screwdriver, bend inward the plastic tab on the lower left side holding the LCD to the PCB to release it.\n",
    " 12. Gently fold the LCD screen up to reveal two metal screws.\n",

    "## Building From Source\n",
    "\n",
    "Source code can be found here: https://github.com/mobilinkd/uv-k5-firmware-custom\n",

    "## Configuring the Radio\n",
    "\n",
    "When using digital modulation, all settings that can be disabled should be disabled. CTCSS, DCS,\n",
    "VOX, any of the tail squelch elimination settings, power saver, etc. These should all be turned\n",
    "off. The firmware should ignore most of these settings when in digital mode, but things like\n",
    "power saver are not, and not all settings have been thoroughly tested at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main setting to change is the `Demodu` setting. This must be changed to `DIG`. You will see\n",
    "`DIG` shown in place of `FM` in the display. This changes the modulation and demodulation mode\n",
    "to `Digital Modulation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VOX\n",
    "\n",
    "VOX must be disabled. The pre-built firmare has the VOX feature disabled entirely so that there is\n",
    "no possibility of accidentally enabling this. VOX turn-around time is far too slow for digital\n",
    "communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wide vs. Narrow\n",
    "\n",
    "The `W/N` setting should be set appropriately for the type of modulation. For 9600 baud GFSK, \n",
    "use `WIDE`. For 4-FSK modes, which have a narrower occupied bandwidth, use `NARROW`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the occupied bandwidth is less than 12.5kHz, use `NARROW`, otherwise use `WIDE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep the output level low. The amplifier will easily overload many audio inputs. With the\n",
    "UV-K6, the volume control knob has orange indicators (tick marks). Two ticks, or 1/3rd\n",
    "rotation of the knob, is the maximum level that should be used. This is especially true when\n",
    "using it with the Mobilinkd TNC3 or TNC4. Exceeding this can cause both demodulation issues\n",
    "and behavioral problems with the TNC.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuring the Mobilinkd TNC4\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardware and firmware modifications were tested using a Mobilinkd TNC4. These recommended\n",
    "settings are based on using the radio with a TNC4. Using it with another TNC or modem will\n",
    "require calibration to determine the appropriate settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audio Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The TNC4 should be configured for an output level of 190. This level has been calibrated in\n",
    "the firmware to match the appropriate deviation for GMSK at 9600 baud when in `WIDE` mode\n",
    "and proper deviation for M17 4-FSK when in `NARROW` mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PTT Style\n",
    "\n",
    "The TNC should be configured for `Simplex` PTT style.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audio Input\n",
    "\n",
    "Audio input must be configured for a gain of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modem Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "For M17 mode (or any 4-FSK mode), the `RX Reverse Polarity` must be enabled and `TX\n",
    "Reverse Polarity` must be disabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The above modifications result in the ability to transmit and receive digital modes\n",

    "# Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Better RX performance and improved power efficiency can be acheived by completely bypassing the\n",
    "audio amplifier when in digital mode. It may be possible to do this using a custom PCB similar to\n",
    "what is done with the wide-band receiver modification. A couple of analog switches controlled by\n",
    "the insertion of a connector in the speaker-mic jack would work. There is a switched terminal on\n",
    "the 3.5mm jack which has 3.3V present when nothing is inserted into the jack.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1.4 version of the PCB would make this easy as it has a 0402 0 Ohm shunt to connect the audio\n",
    "amp to the speaker-mic connector. The 1.5 version of the PCB would require modifying the PCB by\n",
    "breaking a wide and easily accessible trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turn-around time can be improved by changing the firmware to configure the transmitter and receiver\n",
    "only when material changes are made. Currently, the firmware reconfigures many BK4819 parameters when\n",
    "switching between transmit and receive. Some of this is likely done to make dual-receive simpler to\n",
    "implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transmit delay is the time between pressing PTT and the time the transmitter is active and\n",
    "at full power. It is currently about 120ms. This is longer than requried.  The firmware does key\n",
    "debounce which requires 30ms. This can be eliminated for PTT in `DIG` mode where PTT is controlled\n",
    "by a modem/TNC. The same improvements for turn-around time will also reduce transmit delay. I suspect\n",
    "it is possible to get each down to around 40ms without too much work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deviation values when in `DIG` mode for Wide and Narrow modes are hard-coded in the firmware\n",
    "to values that work well for the TNC4. These should be moved into EEPROM settings to make it easier\n",
    "to match the radio to other modems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "## MIC Input Bias\n",
    "\n",
    " - The MIC input bias shoots up to ~3V at power-on. The nominal value for this is 1/2 the ADC voltage\n",
